								<p>Hi, I am Mohammad Ammar, a Computer Engineering Undergraduate and an aspiring Researcher obsessed with Deep Learning and AI. My faintest memory of computers is from when I was seven years old. My father bought a computer for the home, and I was excited. He taught me how to use it and made the computer guy install some games for me. Playing with toys and RC cars, this machine was magical to me, and it was more fun to play with. Growing up, I wondered whether these things would ever be like humans. My father always told me that computers and humans are fundamentally different and that computers will never be able to mimic humans. Fast forward to the teens, Google launched its assistant. I got to use assistant in 2017 when I was in High School final year. It was wild for me how different it was, and it excited me. 2017 to 2020 were some gruelling years for me as in 2017, I was preparing for the Board exams, and if one is familiar with the Asian way of life, one can comprehend the importance of getting good grades. Standard 11 and 12, also known as the intermediate, are the most challenging and mentally exhausting years of school life. So tiring and exhausting is the journey that many students cannot endure the pressure and commit suicide. I was cut entirely from the world and the exciting developments over these three years, focusing only on my studies. It was when I qualified for the engineering entrance that I got to see the world and its hustle again, and this time from a different perspective. </p>
								<p>I met highly talented people in college who helped me get started in AI and Deep Learning. I learned Python and ML frameworks and began learning from various courses and blogs. At first, the picture was hazy. I was not able to differentiate between AI, Deep Learning and ML. The more I read, the clearer the picture got to the point that I could distinguish between Deep Learning and Machine Learning. I can now implement ML models using Scikit Learn and can do data preprocessing. Soon after this, my attention was grabbed by deep learning. I started by making some basic Neural Nets with TensorFlow and went on to make some convolutional neural nets. I made a shallow neural net using only NumPy to enhance my understanding of deep learning. I was selected as our college's AI/ML Lead for Google Developers Student's Club. I am also a computer team member at our college's Autonomous Under Water Vehicle club. I am an avid reader and read many blogs related to DL. Recently I was selected for the 'Research Experience for Undergraduate', a prestigious program offered by APJ Abdul Kalam STEM-ER Center in collaboration with Ohio State University.
								</p>
								<p>I am always looking for new models, techniques and concepts in deep learning by reading recently published papers in the domain. My goal is to pursue a thesis-based master's in the US. I also want to pursue a PhD. My current research project includes solving medical image classification tasks using SOTA lightweight hybrid models. In future, I would like to compare Nested Hierarchical Transformers with Light-Weight Hybrid Models and purely CNN-based lightweight models. This will be done across multiple domains, such as accuracy, data efficiency and interpretability.  </p>
